# Covid-19 Analysis

We everywhere see the data "How many total cases does a country have?" or "Daily deaths". What I wanted to see is how the countries hold up if you calculate the data per head and this is what I did. Also I created other data which intersted me, e.g. the developement of COVID-19 in italy and china.

# Findings
Testing is heavily unbalanced and the US is doing very bad and they aren't even doing that much testing.
