# Covid-19 Analysis
We see everywhere "How many total cases does a country have?" or "Daily deaths". What I wanted to see is how the countries hold up if you use normalized data. Also, I created other data which interested me, e.g. the development of COVID-19 in Italy and china.

# Findings
Testing amount between countries is heavily unbalanced. Also, the US is doing very poorly, and they aren't even doing that much testing. 
The massive increase of testing in Luxembourg surprised me. This is explained by the start of government issued "Large Scale Testing" in Luxembourg ("Everyone will get tested").
