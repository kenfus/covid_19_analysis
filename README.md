# Covid-19 Analysis

We everywhere see the data "How many total cases does a country have?" or "Daily deaths". What I wanted to see is how the countries hold up if you calculate the data per head and this is what I did. Also I created other data which intersted me, e.g. the developement of COVID-19 in italy and china.

# Findings
Testing is heavily unbalanced and the US is doing very bad and they aren't even doing that much testing. Also the massive increasing of testing in luxembourg surpised me when I updated the notebook with the current data (You only need to rerun the whole notebook to get the newest data). This is explained by the start of "Large Scale Testing" in Luxembourg.
